Jiankang Deng obtained his PhD degree under the supervision of Prof. [Stefanos Zafeiriou](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/szafeiri/) and he was funded by the [Imperial President's PhD Scholarship](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/presidents-phd-scholarships/). He has been working in the field of deep face analysis with particular interests in building real-world working systems (e.g. [InsightFace.ai](http://insightface.ai/) and [Facesoft.io](https://craft.co/facesoft)). He also won many visual perception challenges (e.g. ImageNet and ActivityNet) in the past years.
