I am a computer vision researcher at Huawei London Research Center, where I lead the [Mobile Vision Perception (MVP)](https://jiankangdeng.github.io/team/) group. I am also an honorary lecturer at the Department of Computing, Imperial College London.
I received my Ph.D. from the [IBUG](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/home) group in the year 2020, supervised by Prof. [Stefanos Zafeiriou](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/szafeiri/). 
My main research interests include deep face analysis and modeling (e.g., [ArcFace](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Deng_ArcFace_Additive_Angular_Margin_Loss_for_Deep_Face_Recognition_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf) for robust feature embedding, [RetinaFace](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Deng_RetinaFace_Single-Shot_Multi-Level_Face_Localisation_in_the_Wild_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf) for efficient geometry estimation, and [UVGAN](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Deng_UV-GAN_Adversarial_Facial_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf) for photorealistic texture modeling), with a great passion for building real-world working systems (e.g., [InsightFace.ai](http://insightface.ai/) and [Facesoft.io](https://craft.co/facesoft)). I have also worked in the field of visual representation learning and have won many visual perception challenges (e.g., [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/challenges/beyond_ilsvrc) and [ActivityNet](http://activity-net.org/challenges/2017/program.html)) in the past years.
