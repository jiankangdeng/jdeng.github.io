I am a computer vision researcher. My recent research explores (1) **multi-modality foundation models**, focusing on perceiving, understanding, modeling, and replicating complex human intelligence, and (2) **generative modeling of the physical world**, aiming at synthesizing scalable and reliable digital twins of real-world entities. My research is at the intersection of computer vision and practical applications, striving to pioneer transformative technologies for social benefit.

Previously, I obtained my Ph.D.(2020) from the [IBUG](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/home) group under the supervision of Prof. [Stefanos Zafeiriou](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/szafeiri/). 
My doctoral research focused on deep face analysis and modeling, encompassing efficient geometry estimation, robust feature embedding, and photorealistic texture modeling. I developed algorithms and systems ([InsightFace.ai](http://insightface.ai/)) to capture, represent, and synthesize diverse human faces with high efficiency, robustness, and fidelity. Additionally, I worked in the field of visual representation learning and won many visual perception challenges (e.g., [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/challenges/beyond_ilsvrc) and [ActivityNet](http://activity-net.org/challenges/2017/program.html)) in the past years.
